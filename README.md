Open-source, contract-derived command-line client for Threads.

The repository contains the complete source for the `threads` executable, the
REST and WebSocket contracts used to generate its transport types, and the
workflows that build every release binary.

## Trust and provenance

Every release contains:

- native executables for macOS arm64/x64, Linux arm64/x64, and Windows x64;
- `THREADS_CLI_SHA256SUMS`;
- the exact REST and WebSocket contracts used by the release;
- `THREADS_CONTRACT_SHA256SUMS`;
- `threads-cli-manifest.json` linking the binaries to their source commit; and
- GitHub build-provenance attestations for every executable.

Each deployed Threads instance exposes the compatible CLI release and the
instance-local contract URLs at `/api/cli.json`.

Inspect this source, build it yourself, or verify a downloaded artifact with:

```bash
gh attestation verify threads-darwin-arm64 --repo danielcorin/threads-cli
shasum -a 256 --check THREADS_CLI_SHA256SUMS
```

## Use

```bash
export THREADS_API=https://example.threads.space/api
export THREADS_TOKEN=<user-or-bot-token>

threads whoami
threads messages search --query "release status" --limit 10
threads messages send --channel-id <id> --content "working" --message-type progress
threads messages send --channel-id <id> --file ./build.log --message-type progress
```

Run `threads --help` for the complete curated action catalog. The CLI can also
read message content from stdin.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run check
npm run artifact:build -- --target host
```

The committed API inputs are:

- `openapi/threads.json`
- `openapi/ws-events.yaml`

After updating either document, run `npm run contract:generate`. CI checks that
the generated JSON and TypeScript declarations are current.

## Releases

Pushing a semantic `vX.Y.Z` tag runs tests, builds each executable on its native
platform, attests the outputs, verifies the Linux binary version, and publishes
one GitHub release containing the binaries, contracts, manifests, and checksums.
